This project contains an implementation of a decision tree learner.

The decision tree only classifies datasets with binary labels.

Run
----------------------------------------
dt-learn expects datasets in the form of .arff files

To run the learning and prediction script, run:
>> dt-learn <train-set-file> <test-set-file> m

where a node in the decision tree stops splitting when there are fewer than m
instances in the training set at that node. (There are other stopping criteria
as well)
